# artificial-intelligence

Intriguing assignment code written in an intro to AI course. Contains:

- A decision tree builder which uses entropy calculations to turn example car buying choices into a decision tree.
- A "Game of SIM" implementation which plays a human against a computer player using a map of points to model the game grid.
- "Schelling's Neighborhood Model," a model which demonstrates how local decisions can lead to splits of neighborhoods as seen in, for example, the city of Manhattan. 
- A perceptron-training program that trains a perceptron to output 1 given certain input and 0 given any other input.
